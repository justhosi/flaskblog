				<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I have studied financial managment in the university but I'd worked in sales department of medical equipment for different companies in more than 10 years. Coffee also is my passion. It started as a hobby but during years I got professional opportunities and I took them.
				<p>
					Now a days I have to live outside of my country and I always had so much love for coding. So I became a developer. Many years of experience has tought me how to work under pressure, be a team player and how to be patient.
